***Notes building Inquiry Controller***

in the create action, if the inquiry saves, we want to render
the json for that inquiry variable, and we add status: :accepted 
to allow us to send status codes with our fetch request telling the
client on the front end if this request was rejected or accepted and why

            **STATUS CODES**
*unprocessible_entity means the server understands the content of the request
and the syntax is correct, but it was unable to process the instructions

fast_jsonapi gem gives you access to serializer generator

**Don't NEED serializer for js project, but it is something you want
because it becomes more helpful as your projects API starts to get more complex
and it gives you more specificity in nested objects not just one large array,
you will want the attributes KEY

        ***ADD THE :PET MACRO TO GAIN ACCESS TO OBJECTS IN THAT ASSOCIATION
        WITH ONE FETCH CALL BY "attributes.pet.name" <can access because of serializer
