First I need to create my models with their associations and attributes.

I want the user to be able to create and read foster pets who are up for adoption. Possibly later, update their status or delete a pet once adopted.

I want the user to be able to "inquire" or ask if that specific pet is still available for adoption. I also want the user to be able to update their inquiry if they are no longer interested for any reason.
